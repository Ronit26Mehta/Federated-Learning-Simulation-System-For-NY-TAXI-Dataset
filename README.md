# Federated Learning Simulation System for NY Taxi Dataset 🚕🤖

## Overview

Welcome to the **Federated Learning Simulation System for NY Taxi Dataset**! This project simulates a federated learning environment that leverages the **New York Taxi Dataset** to enable distributed machine learning. By keeping data on local devices, our system ensures privacy and security while enabling collaborative model training across multiple nodes.

## Features ✨

- **Federated Learning Simulation**:  
  Experience a true federated learning environment where data remains decentralized on local nodes.

- **Privacy-Preserving Training**:  
  Enhance user data privacy by keeping raw data on local devices while still benefiting from shared learning.

- **Data Partitioning**:  
  Seamlessly partition the NY Taxi dataset to mimic real-world distributed data scenarios.

- **Web-Based Frontend**:  
  An interactive web interface for monitoring training progress, visualizing data, and controlling simulation parameters.

- **Logging & Debugging**:  
  Comprehensive logging (`server.log`) to help track system events, debug issues, and monitor performance.

## Installation 🔧

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Pip**: Python package manager to install dependencies.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Federated-Learning-SImulation-System-For-NY-TAXI-Dataset.git
   cd Federated-Learning-SImulation-System-For-NY-TAXI-Dataset
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend Application**  
   Launch the web-based interface:
   ```bash
   python frontend/app.py
   ```

5. **Train the Federated Model**  
   Execute the federated learning simulation:
   ```bash
   python models/fed-learn.py
   ```

## Usage 🚀

1. **Start the Server**  
   Begin by running the server which will coordinate the federated learning process and manage communication between nodes.

2. **Interact with the Frontend**  
   Open your browser and navigate to the local server address (usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)) to monitor training, visualize results, and manage simulation parameters.

3. **Monitor Logs**  
   Use the `server.log` file to view real-time logging information. This is essential for debugging and performance monitoring.

4. **Data Handling**  
   The system partitions the NY Taxi dataset across multiple nodes. Check `models/splitter.py` for details on how data is distributed.

## Configuration ⚙️

- **Configuration Files**:  
  Customize simulation parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) directly in the code or via configuration files if provided.

- **Environment Variables**:  
  Set environment variables for advanced configurations, such as paths to data sources or logging levels.

- **Modular Design**:  
  The modular structure in the `models` directory allows easy customization and extension of learning algorithms.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ ❓

### Common Issues

- **Server Not Starting**:  
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
  - Check if the port (default: 5000) is available or modify it in `app.py`.

- **Data Partitioning Errors**:  
  - Verify the integrity of the NY Taxi dataset.
  - Check the logic in `models/splitter.py` for any discrepancies.

### FAQ

- **What is Federated Learning?**  
  Federated learning is a machine learning approach where a shared model is trained across multiple decentralized devices while keeping the data localized.

- **How can I extend this project?**  
  You can add new features in the `models` directory or enhance the frontend. See our [Contributing](#development--contributing) section for more details.
